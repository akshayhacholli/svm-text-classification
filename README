Details about the program
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	A program which does text classification using SVM classifier. It uses a external library LIBLINEAR which does the training and classification.
	The program does the following things                                                                                    
		1. It reads the input corpus along with class names
		2. Then reads each file and creates a corresponding training file
		3. Then this training file is passed to the SVM classifier which trains the SVM
		4. After training, a model file is generated which can be later used to test/classify documents(no need to train again)
		5. Every test file is converted into proper format which can be read by library
		6. This test file is passed as input to the trained SVM classifier which outputs the classified values.

Instructions for running the program on UTD CS machines
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1) Java is installed
	2) Program uses stopwords file to filter out stopwords therefore the source folder must contain file with name stopwords
	3) Source code folder must have write permission as the program generates train,test,unique_words and model file
